	<h1>Maternal GWAS of Offspring Birthweight Summary Data (2018)</h1>

	<p>We are releasing the summary data from our maternal genome-wide meta-analyses of offspring birth weight, combining data from the EGG consortium and the first release of the UK Biobank genetics data (released May 2015).</p>
	<p>Data were imputed up to the reference panels from Hapmap Phase 2 (EGG Consortium studies) or combined 1000G and UK10K Project (UK Biobank). Birth weight was z-score transformed. The association between each variant and birth weight was tested separately using a linear regression model, with adjustment for offspring sex and gestational week (both where available) and study-specific ancestry covariates.</p>

	<p>Summary files provide information on chromosome, genomic position (NCBI build 37), rsID, effect allele, other allele, effect allele frequency, beta, standard error, P value and sample size at over 8 million variants passing quality control.</p>
	
	<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
	<p> The data as a gzipped text file can be downloaded here: <a href="./MBW/MBW_Summary_Stats.txt.gz">MBW_Summary_Stats.txt.gz</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Acknowledging The Data</h2>
	
	<p>When using data from the downloadable meta-analyses results please acknowledge the source of the data as follows:</p>
	<p class="quote">Data on offspring birth weight has been contributed by the EGG Consortium using the UK Biobank Resource and has been downloaded from www.egg-consortium.org.</p>
	<p>In addition to the above acknowledgement, please cite the paper below:</p>
