	<h1>Birth Length Summary Data</h1>
	
	<p>We are releasing the summary data from our discovery genome-wide meta-analysis of birth length, in order to enable other researchers to examine particular variants or loci of their interest for association with this trait. The file includes the beta, standard error, P-value and total sample size at over 2 million directly genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the <a href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">HapMap project (NCBI build 36)</a>. Trait values for birth length were transformed to sex and gestational age adjusted SD scores and assessed for association with each SNP using linear regression of the standardized birth length score against genotype using an additive genetic model.</p>
	
	<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
	<p>The birth length dataset was generated by performing a meta-analysis of 22 population-based studies (total N = 28,459 individuals). The data as a gzipped data file can be downloaded here: <a href="./Birth_Length/EGG-GWAS-BL.txt.gz">EGG-GWAS-BL.txt.gz</a>.</p>

	<h2>Acknowledging The Data</h2>
	
	<p>When using data from the downloadable meta-analyses results please acknowledge the source of the data as follows:</p>
	<p class="quote">Data on birth length trait has been contributed by EGG Consortium and has been downloaded from www.egg-consortium.org.</p>
