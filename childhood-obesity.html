	<h1>Childhood Obesity Summary Data</h1>

	<p>
	We are releasing the summary data from the genome-wide meta-analysis of childhood obesity (cases defined as BMI>95th percentile; controls defined as BMI<50th percentile) 
	in subjects of European ancestry, in order to enable other researchers to examine particular variants or loci of their interest for association with this trait. The file 
	includes P-values and direction of effect at over 2 million directly genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on the HapMap Utah residents of 
	Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU) SNPs (Phase 2, release 22). To minimize the possibility of identification of individuals from these summary results, we are 
	not releasing allele frequency data from our samples. We assessed for association with each SNP in the case-control setting using an additive genetic model.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
	<p>
	The childhood obesity dataset was generated by performing a meta-analysis of up to 14 studies consisting of 5,530 cases (&ge;95th percentile of body mass index (BMI)) 
	and 8,318 controls (<50th percentile of BMI). The data made available is where the genomic control was applied to the overall meta-analysis results and the results 
	filtered to where there was data available for at least 8 participating cohorts for any given SNP. The data as a gzipped text file can be downloaded here:
