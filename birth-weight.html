	<h1>Birth Weight Summary Data (2013)</h1>

	<p>
		We are releasing the summary data from our genome-wide meta-analyses of birth weight, in order to enable other researchers to examine particular variants or loci of their interest for association with this trait. The file includes P-values and direction of effect at over 2 million directly genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the <a href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">HapMap project (release 27)</a>. To minimise the possibility of identification of individuals from these summary results, we are not releasing allele frequency data from our samples.
Trait values for birth weight (BW) were transformed to a Z-score and assessed for association with each SNP using linear regression of the birth weight Z-score against genotype using an additive genetic model, with sex and, where available, gestational age as covariables.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
	<p>The birth weight dataset was generated by performing a meta-analysis of up to 18 population-based European studies (total n = 26,836 individuals). 
	The data as a gzipped text file can be downloaded here: <a href="./BW2/EGG_BW2_DISCOVERY.txt.gz">EGG_BW2_DISCOVERY.txt.gz</a>.</p>

	<h2>Acknowledging The Data</h2>

	<p class="quote">Data on birth weight trait has been contributed by EGG Consortium and has been downloaded from www.egg-consortium.org.</p>
