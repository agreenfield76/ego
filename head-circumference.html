	<h1>Head Circumference Summary Data</h1>

	<p>
We are releasing the summary data from our genome-wide meta-analyses of infant head circumference, in order to enable other researchers to examine particular variants or loci of their interest for association with this trait. The file includes the beta, standard error, P-values, effect allele frequencies and total sample size at over 2 million directly genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the <a href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">HapMap project (release 27)</a>. Trait values for infant head circumference (HC) were transformed to sex and age adjusted SD scores and assessed for association with each SNP using linear regression of the head circumference Z-score against genotype using an additive genetic model.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
	<p>
The head circumference dataset was generated by performing a meta-analysis of 7 population-based European studies (total n = 10,678 individuals). The data as a gzipped text file can be downloaded here:

	</p>

	<h2>Acknowledging The Data</h2>
