	<h1>Gestational Weight Gain GWAS Summary Data (2017)</h1>

	<p>We are releasing the summary data from our genome-wide meta-analyses of gestational weight gain (GWG), combining data from cohorts within the EGG consortium. 
Data were imputed up to the reference panels from the <a href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">HapMap Phase 2 (Build 36, release 22)</a>.</p>
	<p>Three phenotypes were investigated:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Total GWG:</strong> the last gestational weight (&le; 28 weeks of gestation) before delivery minus pre-/early-pregnancy weight divided by the length of gestation in weeks at the last measurement.</li>
		<li><strong>Early GWG:</strong> the difference between pre-/early-pregnancy weight and weight measured any time between 18 and 20 (inclusive) completed weeks of gestation divided by length of gestation in weeks at the time of the 18 to 20 week measurement.</li>
		<li><strong>Late GWG:</strong> the difference between the 18 to 20 week measurement and the last gestational weight measure at &ge; 28 weeks of gestation divided by the gestational age difference in completed weeks between these two measurements.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The association between each genetic variant and gestational weight gain was tested using a linear regression model, with adjustment for sex and study-specific ancestry covariates (where appropiate).</p>

	<p>Summary files provide information on chromosome, genomic position (NCBI build 36), rsID, effect allele, other allele, effect allele frequency, beta, standard error and P value at over 2 million variants passing quality control.</p>
	
	<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
	
	<p>We have six sets of summary files:</p>
