	<h1>Gestational Duration Summary Data (2023) </h1>
	
	<p>We are releasing the summary data from our maternal genome-wide meta-analyses of gestational duration, preterm and post-term deliveries combining data from the EGG consortium and other large cohorts. Data were imputed up to the reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 1 v3) or HRC reference panel or a combination of these with cohort-specific whole genome sequences. Gestational duration was assessed in days, only for spontaneous deliveries. Preterm delivery was defined as a spontaneous delivery <259 days (37 completed gestational weeks) or by using the ICD-10 O60 code, and controls as a delivery occurring between 273 and 294 days (39 and 42 gestational weeks). Post-term delivery was defined as a delivery occurring >294 days (42 completed weeks) or ICD-10 O48 code, and controls as a spontaneous delivery between 273 and 294 days (39 and 42 gestational weeks). </p>
	
	<p>Summary files provide information on chromosome, genomic position (NCBI build 37), rsID, effect allele, other allele, effect allele frequency, beta, standard error, p-value, sample size, heterogeneity score, and heterogeneity p-value at approximately 9 million variants passing quality control.</p>
