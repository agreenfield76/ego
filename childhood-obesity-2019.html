	<h1>Childhood Obesity (2019)</h1>
	
	<p>We are releasing the summary statistics from our most recent trans-ancestral meta-analysis of childhood obesity. This is a case control study in which cases are defined as an individual whose BMI is greater than or equal to the 95th percentile at any point in childhood and controls are defined as an individual whose BMI was less than or equal to the 50th percentile consistently throughout childhood for all available measures.</p>
	<p>The samples were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel and grouped into 4 different groups based on ancestry. The summary statistics from these 4 groups were used as input for the trans-ancestral meta-analysis using MANTRA. P-values, beta and standard errors within each group were calculated by variance weighted meta-analysis. Combined stage 1 and stage 2 summary statistics are reported for variants that were taken forward to stage 2.</p>
