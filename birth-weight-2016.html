	<h1>Birth Weight Summary Data (2016)</h1>
	
	<p>We are releasing the summary data from our genome-wide meta-analyses of birth weight, combining data from the EGG consortium and the first tranche of the UK Biobank data (released May 2015).  Data were imputed up to the reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 1 v3) or combined 1000G and UK10K Project. Birth weight was z-score transformed in males and females separately. The association between each variant and birth weight was tested separately in males and females using a linear regression model, with adjustment for gestational week (where available) and study-specific ancestry covariates.</p>
	
	<p>Summary files provide information on chromosome, genomic position (NCBI build 37), rsID, effect allele, other allele, effect allele frequency, beta, standard error, P value and sample size at over 16 million variants passing quality control.</p>
	
	<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
	<p>We have two sets of summary files:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><p>European-only meta-analysis of up to 143,677 individuals; the data as a gzipped text file can be downloaded <a href="./BW3/BW3_EUR_summary_stats.txt.gz">here</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Trans-ancestry meta-analysis of up to 153,781 individuals; the data as a gzipped text file can be downloaded <a href="./BW3/BW3_Transethnic_summary_stats.txt.gz">here</a>.</p></li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Acknowledging The Data</h2>
	
	<p>When using data from the downloadable meta-analyses results please acknowledge the source of the data as follows:</p>
	<p class="quote">Data on birth weight trait has been contributed by the EGG Consortium using the UK Biobank Resource and has been downloaded from www.egg-consortium.org.</p>
	<p>In addition to the above acknowledgement, please cite the paper below:</p>
