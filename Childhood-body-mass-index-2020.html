	<h1>Childhood BMI Summary Data (2020)</h1>
	
	<p>These data represent the results from the discovery stage of a fixed effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of sex- and age-adjusted BMI-standard deviation scores. The analyses include up to 39,620 children from up to 26 studies.  Data were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project or The Haplotype Reference Consortium. After the meta-analysis, we excluded SNPs for which information was available in less than 50% of the studies and less than 50% of the total sample size. </p>
