	<h1>Head Circumference Summary Data (2022)</h1>
	
	<p>These data represent the results from the discovery stage of a fixed effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of sex- and age-adjusted standard deviation scores for head circumference between 6 and 30 months of age (closest to 18 months, if multiple measurements were available) and at birth. The analyses of head circumference between 6 and 30 months include up to 22,279 children from up to 21 studies; the analyses of head circumference at birth include up to 32,084 children from up to 23 studies.  Data were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project or The Haplotype Reference Consortium. After the meta-analysis, we excluded SNPs for which information was available in less than 50% of the studies and less than 50% of the total sample size. </p>
	
	
	<h2>Dataset Details</h2>
	<p>We have two sets of summary files:</p>
	
	
	
	<ol>
		<li><p><a href=HC2/HC_INFANT.filteredDf0.txt.gz>HC_INFANT.filtered.Df0.txt.gz</a>: These are the results for the analyses of head circumference between 6 and 30 months.</p></li>
		<li><p><a href=HC2/HC_BIRTH.filteredDf0.txt.gz>HC_BIRTH.filtered.Df0.txt.gz</a>: These are the results for the analyses of head circumference at birth.</p></li>
	</ol>
	

	<p> Columns are: </p>
	<p> ID: SNPID </p>
	<p> CHR: chromosome </p>
	<p> POS: position </p>
	<p> chrpos: "chromosome:position" </p>
	<p> Allele1: Effect allele </p>
	<p> Allele2: Other allele </p>
	<p> Freq1: Allele frequency of Allele 1 </p>
	<p> FreqSE: Standard error for Freq1 </p>
	<p> MinFreq: Lowest frequency of Allele 1 across individual contributing studies </p>
	<p> MaxFreq: Highest frequency of Allele 1 across individual contributing studies </p>
	<p> Effect: Effect estimate from regression analysis </p>
	<p> StdErr: Standard error of the effect estimate </p>
	<p> P.value: Pvalue </p>
	<p> Direction: Direction of effect in the individual contributing studies, with + meaning positive, - meaning negative, ? meaning study did not contribute information to this SNP </p>
	<p> HetISq: Heterogeneity I-squared </p>
	<p> HetChiSq: Heterogenetiy chi2 </p>
	<p> HetDf: Heterogeneity degrees of freedom </p>
	<p> HetPVal: Pvalue for heterogeneity </p>
	<p> TotalSampleSize: Total sample size contributing information to the SNP </p>
